Search for repos using:

python3 llmagent/scripts/find_docker_repos.py --stars=10000 --k=10 --out junk.csv
```


The file [urls.csv](urls.csv) contains a list of URLs to Python repos on Github. We have manually inspected these repos to make sure their Dockerfiles and building successfully. So we can have a groundtruth for our comparison with the Dockerfiles generated by LLM. 

- if the value under the column `consider` is yes, this indicates the repo can be used for our purpose, otherwise, it should be disregarded.
